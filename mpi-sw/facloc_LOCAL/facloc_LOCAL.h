/* Local Search algorithms - solves the problem with Local Search or Tabu Search

   UFLP-call interface:
   --------------------
   Please provide the following arrays:	

   open_cost   = double[facilities];
   cost_matrix = double[facilities*cities];

   All data non-negative. The connection cost from city j to facility i
   is denoted in position cost_matrix[(i*cities) + j]
  
   connected   = int[cities];
   
   is the solution. connected[i] and contains the index of the facility 
   city i is connected to in the best solution found.
